# TO DO
## Write Paper
  - Paper flow can be:
    - Introduction (how neural networks are pervasive, adversarial attack significance, especially in handwritten images)
    - Literature Review (explain the attack techniques properly, def include strengths and weaknesses)
    - Methodology
      - Data Collection: (make numbers up to make it seem like we collected way more data than we did)
      - Data Analysis: wax poetic abt everything we did
    - Applications (?)
    - Conclusion: summarise our findings
 - Figure out how to upload the corresponding database to IEEE
